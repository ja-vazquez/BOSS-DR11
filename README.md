# BOSS-DR11
BOSS-DR11 likelihoods and chisquares.

Here, we include 
the files to describe BAO-DR11 (and others datasets) that were used in the paper
[Cosmological implications of BAO mesuarements [arXiv:1411.1074].](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1074)
[Proper citations are also included in the paper.]

##Python 
Python files
are located within [SimpleMC](https://github.com/ja-vazquez/SimpleMC).


##Fortran
The fortran files to be plugged into the CosmoMC code
are also included:

-- Galaxies
* LOWZ
* CMASS
* MGS
* 6dFGS 

-- Lya
* Lya Auto
* Lya Cross

###Chisquare values for the best-fit versions of
cosmological models considered in the paper.

# BOSS-DR12

Files that are included in CosmoMC to run DR12 datasets (no data included yet).

##SimpleMC calibration
We calibrated Planck SimpleMC by using **base_Alens/plikHM_TT_lowTEB** with CosmoMC
